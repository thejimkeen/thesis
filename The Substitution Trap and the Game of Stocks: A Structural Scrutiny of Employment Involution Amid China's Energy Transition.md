**Author：Jim Keen**

**Abstract:**
The current radical transformation of China's energy industry represents not merely a technological succession from "old growth drivers" to "new quality productive forces," but a profound restructuring of the labor market. By contrasting the employment realities of the coal and photovoltaic (PV) sectors, this paper reveals the essential characteristic of current economic growth: "substitutive employment" masking the lack of "incremental employment." Under the dual squeeze of insufficient effective demand and technological advancement (AI and automation), the spillover of labor from productive sectors into low-end services has triggered an "involutionary" zero-sum game within a finite market stock. This structural friction constitutes the micro-foundation of the current deflationary spiral.

**I. Introduction: The Collision of Two Worlds**

The future of the Chinese economy hangs precariously between the blackness of coal and the silver sheen of photovoltaic panels. The livelihoods of approximately 10 million people are entangled in this grand narrative of energy restructuring. On one side stands the coal industry: despite its workforce being halved due to environmental pressures and de-capacity policies (dropping from 5.3 million to 2.5 million), it maintains a negligible layoff rate (0.5%) and high profit margins, fortified by policy barriers. On the other side is the PV industry: despite contributing one-quarter of economic growth and creating three times the number of jobs as coal, it is mired in deep losses (sector-wide projected losses of 126 billion RMB) and massive layoffs (30%).

This stark contrast exposes a paradox: Why does the new energy sector, representing "advanced productive forces," fall far short of the traditional coal industry—often viewed as "backward capacity"—in terms of employment stability? Hidden behind this disparity is the most painful reality of China's economic transition: the trap of substitutive employment.

**II. Substitutive Employment: A Zero-Sum Game of Old Wine in New Bottles**

Traditional economic growth theory tends to assume that technological progress creates new demand, thereby generating incremental employment. However, empirical data is currently correcting this optimistic hypothesis. What we are witnessing is the **"destructive" effect within Schumpeter’s "Creative Destruction"**: new jobs are not established by expanding market boundaries, but by squeezing out existing industries.

The growth of employment in the PV sector is, macroscopically, a mirror image of the population decline in the coal industry; the prosperity of new energy vehicles comes at the cost of atrophy in the traditional internal combustion engine supply chain. This **"Substitutive Employment"** implies that the birth of a new position often accompanies the death of an old one.

More cruelly, this substitution is not an equivalent exchange. Labor squeezed out of manufacturing—whether traditional or advanced—cannot easily transform into high-skilled workers for new industries due to **Skill Mismatch**. Instead, they are forced to sediment downwards into lower-tier sectors.

**III. Saturation of the "Reservoir" and Diminishing Marginal Utility**

When the manufacturing sector (be it traditional or emerging) reduces its absorption capacity due to technological progress or overcapacity, the service sector is typically viewed as the "reservoir" for labor. However, the surge in the number of ride-hailing drivers and delivery riders signals that this reservoir is on the verge of breaching its dam.

Here lies a classic **"Fallacy of Composition"**: for an individual, driving for Didi after unemployment is a rational choice; but for the collective, an infinite increase in supply within a market of finite demand inevitably leads to a precipitous drop in marginal returns.

The observation that "more food delivery orders mean less business for wet markets; more ride-hailing drivers mean saturated car sales" accurately captures the **closed nature of the stock market**. If the boom in the service sector is built upon the contraction of the real economy, its essence is merely the redistribution of existing wealth, not the creation of new wealth. When aggregate demand fails to expand, internal friction—or **involution**—within the service sector becomes inevitable.

**IV. Technological Acceleration and the Formation of the Deflationary Spiral**

The introduction of AI and automation technologies has further exacerbated this contradiction. The ultimate logic of technology is the enhancement of efficiency and the reduction of costs; in the current relations of production, cost reduction is often synonymous with labor reduction.

This forms a dangerous closed loop:
1.  **Supply Side:** Technological progress (e.g., PV manufacturing automation, AI applications) drastically improves production efficiency, leading to an oversupply of goods and services (surging coal inventories, PV overcapacity).
2.  **Demand Side:** Technology displaces labor, forcing squeezed-out workers into low-barrier industries to engage in stock games. This leads to a decline in per capita income, which in turn causes **Insufficient Effective Demand** across society.
3.  **Result:** High-efficiency productivity facing a consumer base with low purchasing power inevitably results in price collapse and deflation.

The deflationary phenomenon we observe is essentially the manifestation of the **tension between advanced productive forces and lagging distribution mechanisms**. The shrinking share of work, fruits allocated to each individual is not due to material scarcity, but precisely because, aided by technology, the substitution rate of capital for labor is too high, compressing labor's share in distribution to its limit.

**V. Conclusion**

Beijing's difficult choice in balancing coal and renewable energy is, in reality, an attempt to repair the rift between social stability and economic efficiency. Regulations designed to protect coal profits are, to some extent, maintaining the survival baseline of the legacy workforce, preventing the greater social unrest that a radical market clearing might trigger.

In summary, the core challenge facing the Chinese economy is no longer merely "choke point" technological sanctions, but how to break the zero-sum game of "Substitutive Employment." If institutional innovation cannot be used to expand effective demand, relying solely on "new quality productive forces" driven by technological upgrades may push up supply while simultaneously manufacturing a massive "useless class" struggling within a stock market. This is not just a game within the energy sector, but a severe interrogation of future social distributive justice.
