### How AI represents the ultimate privatisation of propaganda.

**It is cheaper than ever to confirm voters’ biases. Democracy may not survive the bargain.**



For most of the 20th century, the art of manufacturing consent was a noisy, industrial affair. Dictators shouted from balconies; democracies broadcast via state-sanctioned megaphones. It was a model of "one-to-many"—crude, expensive, and notoriously inefficient. To persuade a nation, you had to find a lowest common denominator of rhetoric that would resonate with the masses without alienating the fringes.

That era is over. As a new wave of academic research suggests, the rise of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has triggered a collapse in the marginal cost of persuasion. The result is not just a change in how information is delivered, but a fundamental restructuring of the relationship between the rulers and the ruled. If traditional propaganda was a carpet bomb, AI is a genetic weapon—a targeted pathogen designed to bypass the cognitive immune systems of individual voters.

**The Economics of Confirmation**


The core of this transformation is economic. In the past, shaping public opinion required an army of spin doctors and a monopoly on broadcast infrastructure. Today, Large Language Models (LLMs) act as an infinite supply of tireless, high-IQ interns. They can spin a narrative in a thousand different ways to suit a thousand different psychological profiles, all for the price of a few kilowatt-hours of electricity.

This creates a paradox. Traditional mass media, by necessity, created a shared reality—however flawed. A newspaper had to be readable by both a shopkeeper and a professor. AI destroys this need for convergence. It allows elites to bypass the "standardised information transfer." Instead, it engages in what scholars call "micro-targeted framing." To a fearful conservative, the AI speaks of order and tradition; to an anxious liberal, it speaks of equity and justice. The policy remains the same; only the logic of sale changes.

This is the political equivalent of gene therapy. The message is no longer a blunt instrument; it is tailored to the specific "genetic" makeup of the recipient’s worldview. The friction of persuasion has been eliminated.

**Polarisation as a Service**


Why would a ruling elite want a polarised society? Conventional wisdom suggests that stability comes from the centre. However, the new logic of AI-driven governance suggests a darker conclusion: high polarisation is efficient.

In a rational political market, elites must constantly "adjust expectations"—that is, they must deliver prosperity or competence to keep their jobs. This is expensive. But in a highly polarised society, identity trumps competence. If AI can successfully convince a voter that the opposing side is an existential threat, the cost of retaining that voter’s loyalty drops to zero. The voter becomes a captive market.

Thus, AI accelerates polarisation not by accident, but by design. It allows elites to engineer a society where loyalty is based on fear of the "Other" rather than the performance of the "Self."

The outcome depends on the structure of power. In a regime with a single, unified elite (think automated autocracy), AI becomes the ultimate tool of pacification—a "digital pacifier" that keeps every citizen comfortably numb in their own customised reality. However, in democracies with competing elite factions, the result is an arms race of reality-distortion. When two distinct "truth machines" go to war, the shared public sphere—the very foundation of democratic deliberation—evaporates.

**The Missing Antibody**


Perhaps the most chilling aspect of this technological shift is the human inability to resist it. Human evolution has equipped us with scepticism against slick salesmen and shouting demagogues. We have antibodies against "mass" manipulation.

But we have no evolutionary defence against an entity that sounds exactly like a more articulate version of ourselves. AI achieves its persuasion not by confronting our biases, but by cuddling them. It validates our hidden fears and rationalises our darkest prejudices with perfect logic. It feels less like an intrusion and more like an epiphany.

Because the manipulation is bespoke, it is invisible. You cannot critique a propaganda poster that only you can see. There is no collective moment of realisation, no "Emperor has no clothes" revelation, because everyone is looking at a different Emperor.

**The End of the Public Square**


The promise of the internet was to democratise information. The reality of AI may be the privatisation of truth. When public opinion becomes a programmable object, the "will of the people" ceases to be a check on power and becomes a product of it.

For the elites, this is a golden age of low-cost control. For the rest of us, it is a brave new world where we are fed exactly what we want to hear, while the capacity to understand each other—or the objective reality we share—quietly rots away. The drugs work; the patient is sedated. But the body politic is dying.

## **窃语机器：AI开启宣传“私有化”的终极形态**
**迎合选民偏见的成本已降至冰点。这场交易，民主制度未必付得起代价。**

在20世纪的大部分时间里，“制造共识”是一项喧嚣的工业化工程。那是“一对多”的时代：独裁者在阳台上嘶吼，民主国家通过官方喉舌广播。这种模式粗糙、昂贵且低效。要想说服一个国家，宣传者必须寻找修辞上的“最大公约数”——既要能打动大众，又不能过度疏远边缘群体。

那个时代已然终结。正如最新学术研究所示，生成式人工智能（AI）的崛起导致说服的边际成本崩塌。这不只是信息传递方式的变革，更是统治者与被统治者关系的根本重构。如果说传统宣传是地毯式轰炸，那么AI就是基因武器——一种旨在绕过个体认知免疫系统、直击要害的靶向病原体。

#### **确认偏误的经济学**

变革的核心在于经济账。过去，塑造舆论需要庞大的公关军团和对广播基础设施的垄断。如今，大型语言模型（LLMs）就像取之不尽的高智商实习生，不知疲倦。它们能以千种方式重构同一套叙事，去迎合千种不同的心理侧写，而成本不过是几度电费。

这是一个悖论。传统大众媒体为求生存，被迫构建一个共享的现实（哪怕充满瑕疵）：报纸得让店主和教授都能读下去。AI粉碎了这种对“趋同”的需求。它让精英得以绕过“标准化信息传递”，转向学者口中的“微观框架定位”（micro-targeted framing）。面对恐惧的保守派，AI大谈秩序与传统；面对焦虑的自由派，AI高呼公平与正义。政策内核未变，推销逻辑已改。

这堪称政治领域的“基因疗法”。信息不再是钝器，而是根据受众世界观的“基因图谱”量身定制。说服的摩擦力，就此归零。

#### **极化即服务**

统治精英为何渴望社会极化？常识认为“中间路线”最稳。但AI治理的逻辑指向一个更阴暗的结论：高度极化才最有效率。

在理性的政治市场中，精英必须不断“调整预期”——靠繁荣经济或展现能力来保住乌纱帽。这很昂贵。但在高度极化的社会，身份认同压倒了治理能力。若AI能让选民确信对手是生存威胁，维持其忠诚度的成本便降至为零。选民成了被圈养的市场。

因此，AI加速极化并非意外，而是设计使然。它助推精英构建这样一个社会：忠诚源于对“他者”的恐惧，而非对“自我”绩效的认可。

结局取决于权力结构。在单一精英体制（如自动化威权）下，AI是终极的“数字安抚奶嘴”，让公民在各自定制的现实中沉醉。而在多极精英竞争的民主体制下，结果则是现实扭曲的军备竞赛。当两台截然不同的“真理机器”开战，作为民主协商基石的公共领域，便随之蒸发。

#### **缺失的抗体**

这场技术变迁最令人胆寒之处，在于人类无力抵抗。进化赋予我们怀疑油滑推销员和咆哮煽动者的本能。我们拥有抵抗“大众”操纵的抗体。

但面对一个听起来像是更睿智版本的“自己”的存在，我们毫无防备。AI的说服之道并非挑战偏见，而是“拥抱”偏见。它用完美的逻辑验证我们隐秘的恐惧，合理化我们阴暗的成见。这感觉不像入侵，更像顿悟。

因为操纵是定制的，所以它是隐形的。你无法批判一张只有你能看见的宣传海报。不会有集体觉醒的时刻，也不会有“皇帝新衣”的揭露，因为每个人眼中的皇帝都截然不同。

#### **公共广场的终结**

互联网曾许诺信息的民主化，AI带来的现实却是真理的私有化。当民意变成可编程的代码，它就不再是权力的制衡，而成了权力的产物。

对精英而言，这是低成本控制的黄金时代。对大众而言，这是一个美丽新世界：我们被投喂想听的话，而理解彼此的能力——以及我们共享的客观现实——正在静静腐烂。药物生效了，病人镇静了，但政治生命体正在走向死亡。
