**Abstract:**
The foundational logic behind the rise of a "World Factory" lies not merely in the comparative advantage of factor costs, but in the institutional trust and certainty of supply established through commercial contracts. However, when commercial issues yield to geopolitical maneuvering and supply cutoffs are deployed as a strategy of "flipping the table," the underlying logic of global trade shifts abruptly from "efficiency first" to "security first." This paper argues that the collapse of trust caused by political intervention compels demand-side actors to incur high sunk costs to reconstruct supply chains. This reconstruction process exhibits a profound "Hysteresis Effect," ultimately resulting in the irreversible substitution and marginalization of the original dominant suppliers.

**I. Introduction: Commercial Trust—The Invisible Infrastructure of Globalization**

Traditional international trade theories, such as the Heckscher-Ohlin model, often overemphasize factor price differentials—like labor and land—while neglecting the core variable in **Transaction Costs**: trust. China’s ascension to the status of the "World Factory" was not solely predicated on being "cheap enough"; more crucially, it relied on the ultra-large-scale manufacturing capabilities and the high degree of fulfillment **certainty** demonstrated over the past four decades.

For multinational buyers, price fluctuations caused by market volatility are calculable **"operational risks"** that can be mitigated through hedging or inventory management. However, supply disruptions driven by government will fall into the category of incalculable **"Knightian Uncertainty."** When a "supply cutoff" becomes a Sword of Damocles hanging overhead, the very premise of commercial operation ceases to exist.

**II. From "Just-in-Time" to "Just-in-Case": A Paradigm Shift in Procurement Logic**

Once supply chains are endowed with the attributes of political leverage, the decision function of the buyer changes fundamentally.

In times of peace, a corporation's core objective is **profit maximization**, following the "Just-in-Time" principle to pursue zero inventory and extreme efficiency. However, when the risk of cutoff emerges, the core objective instantly switches to **survival and business continuity**.

At this juncture, **profitability is no longer the primary consideration; risk control is.** Buyers will sacrifice profit margins to reconstruct their systems through the following methods:
1.  **Redundancy Construction:** Moving from Single Sourcing to Multi-sourcing, even if alternative options come with higher costs and lower quality.
2.  **Near-shoring/Friend-shoring:** Relocating production stages to political allies or domestic soil in exchange for political security.
3.  **Vertical Integration:** In extreme cases where effective supply cannot be confirmed, companies are forced to vertically integrate and "reinvent the wheel."

This shift signifies that **Resilience** is replacing **Efficiency** as the new creed of global supply chains.

**III. The Cost of "Flipping the Table": The Irreversible Reconstruction of the Ecosystem**

The strategy of supply cutoff, or "flipping the table," is an extreme **threat strategy** in game theory. While it may gain leverage in the short term by squeezing the opponent's "choke points," it is, in the long run, a **suicidal attack**.

The reason lies in the **"Hysteresis Effect"** of supply chain reconstruction. Establishing new supply chains (e.g., opening new mines, building new wafer fabs, training new workers) requires massive Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) and time.
*   **High Entry Barrier:** Starting is difficult.
*   **Higher Exit Barrier:** Once the new supply chain is established, the massive sunk costs have been paid, and new interest groups (new suppliers, new labor pools) have formed.
*   **The Result:** Even if the original supplier attempts to restore supply and lower prices later, the buyer will not return. Once trust is shattered, the cost of repair approaches infinity.

**IV. Mirror Images: The Dual Dilemma of GPUs and Rare Earths**

The two cases mentioned in the analysis accurately reflect the mirror image of this predicament:

1.  **The US GPU Ban:** The US attempts to curb China's AI development by cutting off the supply of high-end computing power. This forces Chinese companies to abandon reliance on Nvidia and "involuntarily" cultivate domestic alternatives like Huawei’s Ascend chips. Once China’s domestic hardware-software ecosystem loop is closed (however difficult initially), US chip giants will permanently lose their largest single global market and will have created a formidable competitor.
2.  **China’s Rare Earth Gambit:** If rare earths are used as a counter-weapon, the West will feel pain in the short term. However, this threat directly stimulates the restart and expansion of mines like Mountain Pass in the US and Lynas in Australia, as well as Japan’s R&D into rare earth substitutes. Long-term, this leads to the "de-sinicization" of the rare earth supply chain, weakening China's monopoly power in this field.

**V. Conclusion: The Prisoner's Dilemma in Global Risk Rebalancing**

The essence of commerce is mutual benefit, while the essence of politics is often exclusion. When supply chains become geopolitical weapons, we are witnessing the disintegration of the global division of labor.

For any supplier in a monopoly position (whether technological or resource-based), **the greatest threat is not a competitor, but the customer's sense of insecurity.** When cutting off supply becomes an option, customers, for the sake of survival, will inevitably spare no cost to support a "Plan B" or enter the arena themselves.

Once this reconstruction of the supply chain architecture is complete, the original ecological structure will suffer a devastating blow. This is not merely a loss of market share, but a permanent tectonic shift in the landscape of global industrial power. In an era where commerce is held hostage by politics, there are no winners; we are merely searching for the "least bad" solution among varying costs of hedging.
